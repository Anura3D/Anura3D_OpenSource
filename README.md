_Anura3D_ is a software for the numerical modelling and simulation of large deformations and
soil‚Äìwater‚Äìstructure interaction using the material point method (MPM). Copyright (C) 2020 Members of the Anura3D MPM Research Community.

# Main Features

The features implemented in the open source are briefly summarized in the Table below. While some of them have been tested, others are still under development. The examples provided in the tutorial provide guidance to the user through the available tested features.

_State legend_:

‚úîÔ∏è: Available and tested

üöß: Under development

|Feature| State|
|---|---|
|**Geometrical dimensions**| |
|2D-plane strain | ‚úîÔ∏è|
|2D-axisymmetric | üöß|
|3D-cartesian| ‚úîÔ∏è|
|3D-cylindrical| ‚úîÔ∏è|

The current state of the Anura3D has the following limitations concerning the tested features:


* 3D-Cylindrical: y-axis is the axis of symmetry, gravity can only be applied in y-axis direction.
* Multiphase formulations: a combination of different material types can cause problems for certain combinations (undrained total stress and undrained effective stress), no water flow is transferred between saturated and dry materials.
* Contact algorithm: the maximum number of contact materials is four (4), the maximum number of master materials is one (1). Contact is fixed on the mesh nodes.
* Moving mesh: works only for prismatic bodies in 3D and trapezium areas in 2D, the moving mesh direction is constrained only in one direction. the moving mesh needs an extension and/or compression mesh.
* Excavation: limited to 30 excavation stages.
* Rigid body: can be applied only to one body in the system, only works together with the contact algorithm, only moves in one direction, it can‚Äôt rotate.
* Fixities and traction boundary conditions: only aligned with the coordinate axes
* K0 stress initialization: limited only to horizontal surfaces, one homogeneous material (otherwise, use gravity together with local damping and stress initialization with quasistatic convergence criteria).
The user should also take into account the following warnings:
* Multiple materials: the use of several drainage material types on the same model is not recommended.
* Absorbing boundaries: do not prevent material points from leaving the mesh.
