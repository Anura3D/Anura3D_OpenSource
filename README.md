## Scientific manual

The [scientific manual](https://github.com/Anura3D/Anura3D_OpenSource/blob/main/src/GiD_Problemtype/doc/ScientificManual_2021.pdf) describes the numerical framework, theoretical models, and numerical techniques implemented in _Anura3D_.

<!-- ## Coding manual

We love people that modifies our code and develops useful and cool features. We provide the _coding manual_ to ensure uniformity of coding style, documentability, generality, and compatibility with existing features.
